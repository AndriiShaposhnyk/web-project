    <h2>Superman</h2>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman"><img src="img/superman.jpg" alt="Superman Story"></a>
    <p>A long time ago, on a distant planet called Krypton, a baby named Kal-El was born. His planet was about to be destroyed, so his parents put him in a small spaceship and sent him to Earth — hoping he would survive.</p> 
      <p>That baby landed in a small town in Kansas, where he was found and adopted by a kind farming couple, the Kents.</p> 
      <p>They named him Clark Kent and raised him like a normal boy.
      But Clark was not normal.As he grew older, he discovered he had amazing powers:</p>
<ul> <li>He could fly</li>
  <li>He was super strong</li>
  <li>He had laser vision</li>
  <li>And he could hear things from miles away</li>
</ul>
When he became an adult, he moved to the city of <a href="https://www.metropolisil.gov/">Metropolis</a> and became a reporter. But secretly, he used his powers to help people as Superman — the world’s first superhero.</p>
<p>He wore a red cape, a blue suit, and a bold "S" on his chest.
People called him the Man of Steel, because nothing could hurt him.

Superman always fights for truth, justice, and hope.</p>
<p> He protects the weak, fights evil, and reminds us that goodness is powerful — no matter where you come from.

    <h2>Batman</h2>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman"><img src="img/batman.jpg" alt="Batman"></a>
      <p>In the heart of the dark and dangerous city called Gotham, a young boy named Bruce Wayne lived in a huge mansion with his rich parents.</p>
<p>One night, while walking home after a play, Bruce and his parents were attacked by a robber. The man stole from them — and then did something terrible: he killed Bruce’s parents right in front of him.</p>
<p>Bruce was heartbroken. He promised that one day, he would make sure no one else would suffer like he did.</p>
<p>As he grew up, Bruce trained his body and mind. He studied science, crime, technology, and martial arts. He became</p>
<ol>
  <li>Strong</li>
  <li>Smart</li>
  <li>Fearless</li>
</ol>
<p>But he had no powers. He was just a man. So he became something more. Something that criminals would fear. He became Batman.</p>
<p>Dressed like a bat, with a dark cape, sharp gadgets, and the famous Batmobile, Batman watches over <a href="https://www.dc.com/blog/2022/10/10/a-brief-history-of-gotham-city">Gotham</a> at night.</p>
<p>He hides in the shadows, hunts criminals, and protects the city from villains like the Joker, Two-Face, and The Riddler.</p>
<p>By day, he is Bruce Wayne — a billionaire. By night, he is the Dark Knight — a symbol of justice, discipline, and never giving up.</p>
  <p>Batman doesn’t have powers. He has courage, intelligence, and determination — and that’s what makes him a true hero.</p>
